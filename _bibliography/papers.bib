  abstract = {Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in location-based services that aim to provide personalized suggestions for the user's next destination. Previous works on POI recommendation have laid focused on modeling the user's spatial preference. However, existing works that leverage spatial information are only based on the aggregation of users' previous visited positions, which discourages the model from recommending POIs in novel areas. This trait of position-based methods will harm the model's performance in many situations. Additionally, incorporating sequential information into the user's spatial preference remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Diff-POI: a Diffusion-based model that samples the user's spatial preference for the next POI recommendation. Inspired by the wide application of diffusion algorithm in sampling from distributions, Diff-POI encodes the user's visiting sequence and spatial character with two tailor-designed graph encoding modules, followed by a diffusion-based sampling strategy to explore the user's spatial visiting trends. We leverage the diffusion process and its reversed form to sample from the posterior distribution and optimized the corresponding score function. We design a joint training and inference framework to optimize and evaluate the proposed Diff-POI. Extensive experiments on four real-world POI recommendation datasets demonstrate the superiority of our Diff-POI over state-of-the-art baseline methods. Further ablation and parameter studies on Diff-POI reveal the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed diffusion-based sampling strategy for addressing the limitations of existing methods.},

  abstract  = {Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation plays a vital role in various location-aware services. It has been observed that POI recommendation is driven by both sequential and geographical influences. However, since there is no annotated label of the dominant influence during recommendation, existing methods tend to entangle these two influences, which may lead to sub-optimal recommendation performance and poor interpretability. In this paper, we address the above challenge by proposing DisenPOI, a novel Disentangled dual-graph framework for POI recommendation, which jointly utilizes sequential and geographical relationships on two separate graphs and disentangles the two influences with self-supervision. The key novelty of our model compared with existing approaches is to extract disentangled representations of both sequential and geographical influences with contrastive learning. To be specific, we construct a geographical graph and a sequential graph based on the check-in sequence of a user. We tailor their propagation schemes to become sequence-/geo-aware to better capture the corresponding influences. Preference proxies are extracted from check-in sequence as pseudo labels for the two influences, which supervise the disentanglement via a contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks have pushed state-of-the-arts in graph classifications recently. Typically, these methods are studied within the context of supervised end-to-end training, which necessities copious task-specific labels. However, in real-world circumstances, labeled data could be limited, and there could be a massive corpus of unlabeled data, even from unknown classes as a complementary. Towards this end, we study the problem of semi-supervised universal graph classification, which not only identifies graph samples which do not belong to known classes, but also classifies the remaining samples into their respective classes. This problem is challenging due to a severe lack of labels and potential class shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network framework named UGNN, which makes the best of unlabeled data from the subgraph perspective. To tackle class shifts, we estimate the certainty of unlabeled graphs using multiple subgraphs, which facilities the discovery of unlabeled data from unknown categories. Moreover, we construct semantic prototypes in the embedding space for both known and unknown categories and utilize posterior prototype assignments inferred from the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to learn from abundant unlabeled graphs across different subgraph views. Extensive experiments on six datasets verify the effectiveness of UGNN in different settings.},

Even though graph neural networks (GNNs) have produced promising results on this task, current techniques often presume that label information of nodes is accurate, which may not be the case in real-world applications. To tackle this issue, we investigate the problem of learning on graphs with label noise and develop a novel approach dubbed Consistent Graph Neural Network (CGNN) to solve it. Specifically, we employ graph contrastive learning as a regularization term, which promotes two views of augmented nodes to have consistent representations. Since this regularization term cannot utilize label information, it can enhance the robustness of node representations to label noise. Moreover, to detect noisy labels on the graph, we present a sample selection technique based on the homophily assumption, which identifies noisy nodes by measuring the consistency between the labels with their neighbors. Finally, we purify these confident noisy labels to permit efficient semantic graph learning. Extensive experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CGNN over competing approaches.},

This problem is critical in a variety of real-world applications such as protein clustering and genome analysis in bioinformatics. Recent years have witnessed the success of deep clustering coupled with graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing methods focus on clustering among nodes given a single graph, while exploring clustering on multiple graphs is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a general graph-level clustering framework named Graph-Level Contrastive Clustering (GLCC) given multiple graphs. Specifically, GLCC first constructs an adaptive affinity graph to explore instance- and cluster-level contrastive learning (CL). Instance-level CL leverages graph Laplacian based contrastive loss to learn clustering-friendly representations while cluster-level CL captures discriminative cluster representations incorporating neighbor information of each sample. Moreover, we utilize neighbor-aware pseudo-labels to reward the optimization of representation learning. The two steps can be alternatively trained to collaborate and benefit each other. Experiments on a range of well-known datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GLCC over competitive baselines.},

  abstract  = {Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation, which benefits from the proliferation of GPS-enabled devices and location-based social networks (LBSNs), plays an increasingly important role in recommender systems. It aims to provide users with the convenience to discover their interested places to visit based on previous visits and current status. Most existing methods usually merely leverage recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to explore sequential influences for recommendation. Despite the effectiveness, these methods not only neglect topological geographical influences among POIs, but also fail to model high-order sequential substructures. To tackle the above issues, we propose a Kernel-Based Graph Neural Network (KBGNN) for next POI recommendation, which combines the characteristics of both geographical and sequential influences in a collaborative way. KBGNN consists of a geographical module and a sequential module. On the one hand, we construct a geographical graph and leverage a message passing neural network to capture the topological geographical influences. On the other hand, we explore high-order sequential substructures in the user-aware sequential graph using a graph kernel neural network to capture user preferences. Finally, a consistency learning framework is introduced to jointly incorporate geographical and sequential information extracted from two separate graphs. In this way, the two modules effectively exchange knowledge to mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative filtering (CF) has become one of the most popular and widely used methods in recommender systems, but its performance degrades sharply in practice due to the sparsity and bias of the real-world user feedback data. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation framework AD-AUG to mitigate the impact of the imperfect training data and empower CF models. The key idea of AD-AUG is to answer the counterfactual question: ``what would be a user's feedback if his previous purchase history had been different?''. Our framework is composed of an augmenter model and a recommender model. The augmenter model aims to generate counterfactual user feedback based on the observed ones, while the recommender leverages the original and counterfactual user feedback data to provide the final recommendation. In particular, we design two adversarial learning-based methods from both ``bottom-up'' data-oriented and ``top-down'' model-oriented perspectives for counterfactual learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that the AD-AUG can greatly enhance a wide range of CF models, demonstrating our framework's effectiveness and generality.},

  abstract  = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays a critical role in recommender systems and other applications. Recently, modeling user behavior sequences attracts much attention and brings great improvements in the CTR field. Many existing works utilize attention mechanism or recurrent neural networks to exploit user interest from the sequence, but fail to recognize the simple truth that a user's real-time interests are inherently diverse and fluid. In this paper, we propose DisenCTR, a novel dynamic graph-based disentangled representation framework for CTR prediction. The key novelty of our method compared with existing approaches is to model evolving diverse interests of users. Specifically, we construct a time-evolving user-item interaction graph induced by historical interactions. And based on the rich dynamics supplied by the graph, we propose a disentangled graph representation module to extract diverse user interests. We further exploit the fluidity of user interests and model the temporal effect of historical behaviors using Mixture of Hawkes Process. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method comparing to state-of-the-art approaches.},

More recently, graph neural network based model has gradually become the theme of molecular property prediction. However, there is a natural deficiency for existing methods, that is, the scarcity of molecules with desired properties, which makes it hard to build an effective predictive model. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hierarchically Structured Learning on Relation Graphs (HSL-RG) for molecular property prediction, which explores the structural semantics of a molecule from both global-level and local-level granularities. Technically, we first leverage graph kernels to construct relation graphs to globally communicate molecular structural knowledge from neighboring molecules and then design self-supervised learning signals of structure optimization to locally learn transformation-invariant representations from molecules themselves. Moreover, we propose a task-adaptive meta-learning algorithm to provide meta knowledge customization for different tasks in few-shot scenarios. Experiments on multiple real-life benchmark datasets show that HSL-RG is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches.},
