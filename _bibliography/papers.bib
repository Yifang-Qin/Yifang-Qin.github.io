  abstract  = {Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation plays a vital role in various location-aware services. It has been observed that POI recommendation is driven by both sequential and geographical influences. However, since there is no annotated label of the dominant influence during recommendation, existing methods tend to entangle these two influences, which may lead to sub-optimal recommendation performance and poor interpretability. In this paper, we address the above challenge by proposing DisenPOI, a novel Disentangled dual-graph framework for POI recommendation, which jointly utilizes sequential and geographical relationships on two separate graphs and disentangles the two influences with self-supervision. The key novelty of our model compared with existing approaches is to extract disentangled representations of both sequential and geographical influences with contrastive learning. To be specific, we construct a geographical graph and a sequential graph based on the check-in sequence of a user. We tailor their propagation schemes to become sequence-/geo-aware to better capture the corresponding influences. Preference proxies are extracted from check-in sequence as pseudo labels for the two influences, which supervise the disentanglement via a contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstractnote = {This paper studies the problem of graph-level clustering, which is a novel yet challenging task. This problem is critical in a variety of real-world applications such as protein clustering and genome analysis in bioinformatics. Recent years have witnessed the success of deep clustering coupled with graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing methods focus on clustering among nodes given a single graph, while exploring clustering on multiple graphs is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a general graph-level clustering framework named Graph-Level Contrastive Clustering (GLCC) given multiple graphs. Specifically, GLCC first constructs an adaptive affinity graph to explore instance- and cluster-level contrastive learning (CL). Instance-level CL leverages graph Laplacian based contrastive loss to learn clustering-friendly representations while cluster-level CL captures discriminative cluster representations incorporating neighbor information of each sample. Moreover, we utilize neighbor-aware pseudo-labels to reward the optimization of representation learning. The two steps can be alternatively trained to collaborate and benefit each other. Experiments on a range of well-known datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GLCC over competitive baselines.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative filtering (CF) has become one of the most popular and widely used methods in recommender systems, but its performance degrades sharply in practice due to the sparsity and bias of the real-world user feedback data. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation framework AD-AUG to mitigate the impact of the imperfect training data and empower CF models. The key idea of AD-AUG is to answer the counterfactual question: ``what would be a user's feedback if his previous purchase history had been different?''. Our framework is composed of an augmenter model and a recommender model. The augmenter model aims to generate counterfactual user feedback based on the observed ones, while the recommender leverages the original and counterfactual user feedback data to provide the final recommendation. In particular, we design two adversarial learning-based methods from both ``bottom-up'' data-oriented and ``top-down'' model-oriented perspectives for counterfactual learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that the AD-AUG can greatly enhance a wide range of CF models, demonstrating our framework's effectiveness and generality.},

  abstract  = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays a critical role in recommender systems and other applications. Recently, modeling user behavior sequences attracts much attention and brings great improvements in the CTR field. Many existing works utilize attention mechanism or recurrent neural networks to exploit user interest from the sequence, but fail to recognize the simple truth that a user's real-time interests are inherently diverse and fluid. In this paper, we propose DisenCTR, a novel dynamic graph-based disentangled representation framework for CTR prediction. The key novelty of our method compared with existing approaches is to model evolving diverse interests of users. Specifically, we construct a time-evolving user-item interaction graph induced by historical interactions. And based on the rich dynamics supplied by the graph, we propose a disentangled graph representation module to extract diverse user interests. We further exploit the fluidity of user interests and model the temporal effect of historical behaviors using Mixture of Hawkes Process. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method comparing to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper studies few-shot molecular property prediction, which is a fundamental problem in cheminformatics and drug discovery. More recently, graph neural network based model has gradually become the theme of molecular property prediction. However, there is a natural deficiency for existing methods, that is, the scarcity of molecules with desired properties, which makes it hard to build an effective predictive model. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hierarchically Structured Learning on Relation Graphs (HSL-RG) for molecular property prediction, which explores the structural semantics of a molecule from both global-level and local-level granularities. Technically, we first leverage graph kernels to construct relation graphs to globally communicate molecular structural knowledge from neighboring molecules and then design self-supervised learning signals of structure optimization to locally learn transformation-invariant representations from molecules themselves. Moreover, we propose a task-adaptive meta-learning algorithm to provide meta knowledge customization for different tasks in few-shot scenarios. Experiments on multiple real-life benchmark datasets show that HSL-RG is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches.}
